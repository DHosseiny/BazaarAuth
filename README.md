# BazaarAuth

Using this library, you can always access your users without having to implement a local login. Firstly, this reduces uncertainty/lack of security and bot users due to its unified login solution. It also reduces the cost of user authentication by email or text message. Furthermore, you do not lose user’s history and data in your app after uninstalling or changing the device.
In the first step, Bazzar gives you a unique user id for each user/app which remains the same forever. More fields of user’s information such as username, email and etc. will be available in the future after the addition of the user's permission feature.
